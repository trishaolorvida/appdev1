As a software manager, I oversee a development team that handles various projects. Recently, another department approached me with a request for a joint effort. They were seeking help from our software engineers to support their team in the Research and Development (R&D) department, as they were facing tight deadlines. The challenge was clear: the R&D department needed assistance to meet their target dates, and we had to step in and assist, despite the fact that there was a significant learning curve involved.

Although the schedule was already very tight, we decided to lend our support to help them meet their goals. Despite the initial challenges, the collaboration showed promising progress. However, as we were nearing the end of the project and approaching the target deadline, one of my developers faced a personal family crisis, which unfortunately disrupted our progress and further jeopardised our ability to meet the deadline.

As a Manager:

I would assess the situation first, I would have a private conversation with the affected developer to understand the nature of their crisis and how it might impact their work. This would help me gauge their current capacity and willingness to contribute. And assess how their absence or reduced capacity will affect the project timeline and identify critical tasks that may be impacted.

I will review the skills and workloads of other team members to identify who can take on the affected developer’s responsibilities. This may involve reassigning tasks to ensure that critical work continues. Depending on the developer’s situation, I will consider adjusting their workload temporarily, allowing them to focus on essential tasks while taking a step back from less critical work.

Next, I will inform the team about the situation without going into personal details. Emphasize the importance of supporting one another and the need for collaboration during this time. Foster a collaborative environment where team members can help each other out and encourage them to share knowledge and resources, especially regarding the R&D project.

I will reach out to the client or stakeholders involved in the R&D project to communicate the situation. Be honest about the challenges being faced but focus on the steps being taken to mitigate any delays. If necessary, I will discuss potential adjustments to the project timeline or deliverables and clearly outline what can still be achieved and any revised deadlines.

What Could Have Been Done Better? Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose. What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or managed it more effectively?




As a Developer:

If I were a developer facing a family emergency during a critical project, I would take a structured approach to manage my workload and communicate effectively with my manager and team to minimize the impact on the project timeline. I would quickly assess how the family emergency affects my ability to work. Determine whether I can continue to contribute part-time or if I need to take a temporary leave.

If possible, I would request a private meeting with my manager as soon as possible to discuss my situation. I would approach the conversation with transparency but keep personal details to a minimum and clearly explain that I am facing a family emergency and outline how it may affect my work. I would specify my current capacity and any immediate deadlines I might struggle to meet.

I would present a plan for managing my workload during this time. This could include prioritizing critical tasks and deadlines, suggesting tasks that could be delegated to other team members, or proposing flexible working hours if possible. And if appropriate, i would request assistance from colleagues who might be able to take on some of my responsibilities temporarily.

Of course, I would ensure that all my work is properly documented, including the status of ongoing tasks, any issues that might arise, and important decisions. This would make it easy for someone else to pick up if needed. For particular tasks, I would include clear instructions or context in case they need to hand over to someone else.

I should communicate with my team about which times they can expect to reach me and how best to contact me during those times. I will be focused at times when I can contribute and avoid distractions as much as possible to maximize my productivity. If it's feasible, I would stay updated with the rest of the team in regular check-ins so I could be informed of what is happening and contribute where possible, with the limitation of the input as appropriate.




What Could Have Been Done:

a risk assessment should have been performed before the team made the commitment. Identified risks would include team member availability and the learning curve of the project. The organization should prepare contingency plans for unexpected situations, such as the immediate and unavailability of a team member, so that delivery can be executed without interruption. Other contingencies include cross-training other team members or having key tasks covered with an alternative plan.

Allow contingencies in the schedule of a project. Provide for those incidents which will not be foreseen and somehow delay time. That could mean you negotiate for extended deadlines or even allocate more resources to the project. Consider your team and their workload and try to ensure that you distribute tasks between members in such a way that allows for flexibility.

Implement regular check-ins to monitor progress and any emerging issues. This creates an environment where team members feel comfortable discussing challenges before they escalate. Encourage open communication about personal issues that may affect work. This way, you can offer support or adjust workloads as needed.

Foster a supportive team culture where personal challenges are acknowledged. This could include offering flexible work arrangements or mental health resources. Encourage team members to communicate their needs and challenges early, allowing the team to adapt accordingly.

The developer facing a personal family crisis should have communicated their situation as soon as it became apparent that it would impact their work. This would allow the manager to make necessary adjustments to the project plan.
Regularly update the team on workload and stress levels, especially when personal issues arise.

The developer should feel empowered to seek support from colleagues when facing challenges, whether technical or personal. This could involve asking for assistance with specific tasks or seeking advice on managing workload.

The developer should take care of themselves and clearly set limits in the workplace to ensure a healthy work-life balance. The practice is being aware of when not to engage, but seek assistance, be it at a personal or professional level.

Cross-training for the team members is also implemented to allow multiple people to be able to accomplish critical tasks. This avoids dependencies on only one person and keeps the momentum going in the project.
